      This page explains our terms of use. When you use GrowingFunds, you’re agreeing to all the rules below. Some of them need to be expressed in legal language, but we’ve done our best to offer you clear and simple explanations—hence the brief summaries in these blue boxes, which are not part of the official legal terms.
      By using this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by GrowingFunds, PBC (together with Drip U.S., LLC, The Creative Independent, LLC, and its and their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors—collectively, “GrowingFunds,” “we,” or “us”), you’re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the “Terms”). You’re also agreeing to our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site, like our Community Guidelines and rules for starting projects.
      We may change these terms from time to time. If we do, we’ll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email. Creators based in the European Union will be notified of material changes at least 15 days before they go into effect. New versions of the terms will never apply retroactively—we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you keep using GrowingFunds after a change, that means you accept the new terms.
      GrowingFunds is for your personal, non-commercial use
